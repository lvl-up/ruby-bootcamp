# Shopping Classes


## Introduction

In order to write better Ruby we need to write code that's well encapsulated.


## Objectives

* Use what you have learned in the chapters [10 - 14](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/eloquent-ruby/9780321700308/ch10.html) to start defining classes
* Understand how to refactor code into separate concerns


## Exercise

Extract your previous code into classes to encapsulate the functionality defined in [String Gymnastics 2](../strings-2/string-gymnastics-2.rb).

The last line of your script should read something like the following:

```ruby
till.total # The exact interface is entirely up to you!
```
